# Lead Astray

## Project Description

Lead Astray is a project designed to help pet owners to get reunited with their furry friends. It is designed to make finding a lost pet easier by allowing both lost and found posts.

## Instructions for Use

The application is a deployed website with signup and login capabilities. If you only wish to browse pets, that can be done from the homepage by clicking either of the view options. No login is required for this feature. If you want to make a post you will need to signup and be logged into the application. While logged in, you can access posting capabilities and your profile. All posts are stored in your profile where they can be updated or deleted. You can also update or delete your account from the profile page.
